Epic Tic Tac Toe is an expansion on the classic tic tac toe game.
Nine tic tac toe boards are arranged in a 3x3 grid. The first
player can move anywhere; however, all subsequent moves are placed
in the empty spaces on the board corresponding to the square of 
the previous move (for example, if a player placed a mark on the 
upper-right square of a board, the next player would place a mark 
somewhere within the upper-right board).
\n
If a player cannot move because the indicated board is full, the 
next move may go on any board. 
\n
When a player gets 3 in a row on one board, that board is marked and 
cannot be won by the other player. Victory is achieved when these 
marks make a 3 in a row on the giant 3x3 grid.
